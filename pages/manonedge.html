<p>He wonders if he didn&#39;t have the jetpack, would he still jump?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>No time to worry about that.</em></p>
<p>The police were ten steps behind, guns raised and aiming. I slipped off toward the street below. <em>Whoosh!</em> The air picked up speed around me as I plummeted, tossing my hair and coat about, and the wind was so loud I didn&#39;t hear them shooting at me from behind me on the balcony. Forgot they were there altogether until a bullet whizzed past my peripherals, nearly taking my ear! I pulled the ripcord on my harness and activated the jetpack. Since I was facing down, it kicked me forward into a tumble into the empty space above the square, some 400 feet below. More gunshots above. I noticed them now, but they were cops! I looked back as I tumbled. Their outlines were dark against a dark sky, and it was hard to see clearly, buty they couldn&#39;t be cops. Cops never go out for blood unless you took one of their own, and though I couldn&#39;t make out the details, there were too many on that rooftop. Had to be a sting. S.W.A.T. fuck. I fired my jets again halfway through the turn, changing my trajectory, but I was still in the open. SWAT don&#39;t miss often. Didn&#39;t want to think about what would happen if they missed again and hit my jetpack... Not in that moment. It was a long way down. I kepped shooting my jetpack in bursts, jinking this way and that, making it hard for their computer brains to work out a firing solution for me, but I was quickly losing control myself! And I was tumbling so much I wouldn&#39;t be able to make it back in toward the building like I had planned. I&#39;d already missed my window, but I got lucky again, and my exit came in the form of instats flying through the causeways at the last possible moment, and at a decent clip, too, which meant I had to get up to speed with them, which meant I had to go in a straight line and make SWAT&#39;s job a little easier. I jet left and up, trying to spiral as much as possible around all the bullets flying around me. Oh man, I could feel them at my back. I was just glad they weren&#39;t <em>in</em> my back. The first craft came &#39;round, going at <em>waaay</em> too fast a clip for me to catch. Bastards...</p>
<p>&quot;Slow down for air traffic!&quot; I quoted the velocity warning signs posted around the tunnels and byways of the metro. I&#39;d have to catch the next one, and fast, and hope the SWAT didn&#39;t assume we were accomplices and just shoot us both down, me and the craft. The first craft whizzed past me, but caught me in his updraft, and I spun into the virtual lane.</p>
<p><em>Thanks I guess.</em> Anything to help make me a harder target for those SWAT pigs. But now the other interstats were swerving, trying to pull away from me. I was still tumbling and they were getting farther away from me as they neared. I puffed my jets a few times and did sommersaults, but still, now the craft were really pulling away from me. But oh god did I get lucky. A stray shot clipped the stabilizer of the craft closest to me and sent it tumbling in my direction!</p>
<p><em>Ohthankgodohgodohgodthankyouthank--</em></p>
<p>I caught on to his passenger door as he careened by and hoped the pigs wouldn&#39;t blast us both. Oh fuck. The door nearly took my hand off, even as fast as I had been going relative to the intersat. Well, I caught it, and now we were past the corner of another building. It would take them a minute to mobilize an air squad, and I wondered if I should bail, and ditch the jetpack somewhere and just not go through with the mission at all. Where did all this heat come from? It wasn&#39;t like the authorities to send a kill squad after a guy like me. Something must have really riled them. I was thinking all this when I caught the driver&#39;s eye through the cockpit and I saw that he was looking at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, are you gonna get in? Get in!&quot;</p>
<p>I climbed in the cab, which was difficult as my only handhold was also the door I had to open.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a feeling--I <em>knew</em> it was you the moment I saw you. Just had to be, I had a hunch.&quot;</p>
<p>I was still too tossed about to talk. My stomach felt like it was in my mouth. Wich... Well, I was hoping it wouldn&#39;t be.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re him, right? You&#39;re that kid who&#39;s been doing the art bomb scenes around Drisgall?&quot;</p>
<p>My mouth started to form the word for &quot;who?&quot; But he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m a huge fan! Ya know, fuck the government and everything. Pigs!&quot;</p>
<p>I had felt lucky he talked enough for the both of us, but my mouth was late on the response.</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot; I choked a little bit and hold my breath till my stomach settled.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, the guy been doin&#39; all them paintings across the city--he goes out nights and sets up bombs, see, so as he don&#39;t get caught, but they explode with paint, not fire and he loads some reall jazz in em! Ain&#39;t you that guy?&quot;</p>
<p>Now here I had a chance to remain low-key, if there was still meaning for such a phrase after these last 10 minutes, but again my dumb old mouth was slow on the roll. Just had to spit somethin&#39; out. But he cut me off anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah that&#39;s--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it had to be you. I mean who else would be flyin around the skyways like that, with the pigs on him an&#39; all...&quot;</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>I finally started to come to my senses. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! &#39;Scuse me dude, name&#39;s Abar. It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you, man!&quot;</p>
<p>I was almost bummed I couldn&#39;t introduce him to the fanclub.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh I work over in the PANHAM district. I was on my way back when I saw you tumbling by and thought you could use a lift, dude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha Ha!&quot; It was the first honest laugh I&#39;d had since the feds showed up. And I suddenly felt much more in my own skin. &quot;That I did, too. I was tumbling. They nearly got me more than a couple times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like they did, son.&quot;</p>
