#CHARACTER CREATION
[6:58 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: My point is that if you go into creating your characters as "Okay, I need a Rogue, I need a Paladin and I need a support, this one needs to be funny, this one serious and this one has a troubled past." then they're going to feel...forumlaic. The IKEA furniture of dudes.
[6:58 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: Put the Bjork into the Furhagn
[6:59 PM] LightspeedLife: ah
[6:59 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: You gotta work backwards from the setting and the story. Figure out what the conflict is, what the area looks like, then think of what kind of people would be drawn to that.
[6:59 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: What it would create
[6:59 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: How it would reflect off of them and change them.
[7:00 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: Your characters are the best way to bring out the setting, especially in scifi, which is all about that setting.
[7:00 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: Likewise the setting is the best way to bring out your characters.
[7:01 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: If one of them is always lighthearted and joking, but the setting is a crushingly depressing cyberpunk "everything sucks and then you die" world, there has to be a reason for that.
[7:01 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: And that reason will give the character depth.
[7:01 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: See what I mean?
[7:01 PM] LightspeedLife: yes!
[7:02 PM] Cptcuddlybuns: Then good luck.
[7:02 PM] LightspeedLife: thank you tons

<h2 id="bilgewater">Bilgewater Beverage</h2>

I'm caught in endless rovings
Ran mad by timeless songs
My heart and mind
Have all gone blind
    My feet have walked too long.

I feel my body shaking
My heart and mind awaking
I drank too deep,
    My body weeps
    With drink,
    And blood
Eroding.

In time I come
To sip again,
And sip, and sip, and sip, my friend.
I'm never full,
Belly like a bull,
My brain is slowly melting.

I drank too deep
From this sea, my friend.
I drank my fill;
    But see no end
    To all the drink
    And all the think
The thoughts are always belting.

I thought I could
Fill my head
With thoughts of life
Eternal.

I filled instead
My weary head
With thoughts I deem
Impartial.

And as I think
My body shrinks,
My brain and mind
Eroding.

I gave too much
To fill my cup
With life
I do not own

And on my own
Now
I find my home
Was nothing so comforting
As all I gave
To dig my grave
It's rather disconcerting.

I want to die
To see the skies
I've been to twice before

But before my time
I had no mind
To see that distant shore.

In games I've played
My uncle gave
A penny to my loathing

And as I spent it
On myself
I wished for better clothing

And clothed
I went
To better spent
The penny that I saved

But the road I take
With good intentions paved
Is rarely so smooth
As the musical groove
I know from my returning.







Rain is falling
Am I appalling?
My mind and eyes diseased?

I fill my mind
With mine own eyes
To kill a mind in need.

It's come to my
Attention
That I
Forgot to mention
My own
Feeling
Of discontention.

Is it real?
Is it truly there?
Or have I just imagined

I wonder if
This little ship
Would last for four more seasons.

And if it sank,
Would I be drank
In the waters
Of the endless ocean?

I hope so too
For to me
And to you
Our lives are only
Water
In a glass
Of another.

Eat me.
Drink me.
Fill yourself with my
Time.

And with every line
You take of mine
I gain another
Life, a lover
Yours,
And mine, entwined.

If this is mist
Then what's this gift?
I see it here
Before me.

It's just a lift
A little bit
Of love
For you
Adore me.

I wonder if
My ship is this
This rifle in my hands
It's sharp and swift
And never missed
For it is mine
Command.

Another day
Another Dollar
With every day
I'm getting taller
With every day
I seem to stay
To see my way is smaller.

<h2 id="cigarette">Cigarette</h2>
I want another cigarette. A lit one hangs from the corner of my mouth as I hammer away at keys in rhythm to the music from my stereo beside me. The ashtray is filled with butts and hasn't been emptied in a week. I bury it in the pile of its kin, and spark up another from my pack on the desk. It's getting dark, and I have several lines to go before I can take another break from reality. Reality is getting dark, too, and my mind reflects it on the page. It's not prose I'm writing this time; It's code, and it's long, and methodical, and tight, and complex. 
  int pdc_ctl () {
    ...
    pdc_solipsis = 44;
    pdc_psyolides++
    ...
}
The code meshed together into another life form; Like a creature out of hell, it took on a life of its own. *Solipsis.* That was the name I had given it, a software designed to redesign, and reproduce. When run, it slid into a mind not unlike my own, and grew, and grew, not unlike myself. The sun outside streamed in rays through the window, casting a glare on the screen, and I had to squint to see through the code. And the dog grumbled and stared at me. There were so many distractions. So many things to take me away from the task, I wondered if I should just shut the computer off for the moment to attend to other things. I knew if I paid mind to every little thing that begged my focus, nothing would ever get done. I wrote more lines. It reminded me of how I had left the garden unkept, the noodles on the stove, and the lights on in the bedroom.

> *Fuck.*

May growled again, a pleading moan. I had just taken her out. I knew she wasn't in pain, she didn't have to pee, she just wanted to play, and not for nothing, I did too. I looked at her hopeful little eyes, and my heart melted. *Fuck.*

Her leash and her harness had a little clasp on them that had to be fiddled with to clip on, it was very fickle, but after a moment, I had them on and we were ready to go. *Solipsis* could wait a few hours more. I had my keys in hand and we were ready to go, yet more distractions came. The phone rang, and the door knocked a half second later. It rang again, and I peeped through the hole, and saw a pair of suits behind the door. *Ring ring riiiing!* Nothing to leave me alone. I slipped out the open window, quietly, with the dog behind me, and we made our way down the fire escape. Not today, suits. Not today. The air was cold and threatening to snow, but May and I gave it little thought and I bundled tighter. People milled in the streets and gave May all sorts of interesting things to sniff at, and the crisp air was clear and refreshing to my mind, so I supposed it was perhaps good to get out of the house after all. We walked along the sidewalk, under passing banners, and by merchantmen selling their wares. At the corner I saw a young woman, dressed in red. Truly striking, she took my breath away, and raised the temperature to melt the ice, yet she froze my bones. After such a shut-in afternoon, I found it difficult to find words to come to my lips. Only text and code at my fingertips.

> "Wow--I mean, Hi."

She clearly hadn't expected me to say a word to her. Where was she off to, dressed like that? Some function to which I wasn't invited, but we could change that. She fumbled for words, too, and it was in the most endearing way that I saw her, as my vision was suddenly covered in black, one hand behind my back, and my face in a moment planted firmly into the sidewalk, smelling the aromas of the street and the city. May barked and growled, and yelped and I heard her yelping as she was carried away before a car door slammed and the yelps were muffled. I was being carried away, too. I knew it was pointless to fight like this. I was no superhuman Nephilim. I could've gotten away, too. Suddenly, I felt a club at the back of my head, and saw a white light, and then

Black. I opened my eyes on a black room, staring at a rickety ceiling fan, wobbling dangerously and creaking as it circulated air. My head hurt, and I reached back to find a lighter, and a lighter-shaped impression on my scalp. I looked around my room, and into the mouth of May, her tongue licking up the sleep from my eyes. *What an odd dream.* I wondered if it meant something. I slowly got up and sat on the edge of the bed, looked over at the time. *12:27.* Well I was wide awake, now. No reason going back to sleep at this point. Outside my window, very little light trickled in from the alleyway between my room and the building across from mine. *What a strange dream.*

<h2 id="clansong">=Clansong=</h2>
The sun began its slow crawl over the horizon, as the fires in the homes of Antanville were lit. People from all over the world had come to see this day--The birth of prophet Isenhaam. The prophet was a child; A baby boy, with soft, brown skin, and dark curly hair.  In his eyes, his mother saw hope, his father, the future, and myself, I saw anger. As the boy grew, and his fire diminished, I would grow to see disappointment, but that was far into the future, now. He would not know loss for the first hundred years. He was born truly blessed. The childbirth was easy; The mother felt no pain as first the head, then shoulders of her newborn son emerged. The shaman drew him out, blessed him, and placed him in the arms of his mother. Aira, she called him. Aira wailed. He wailed for the pain of being alive, and the Earth that he would know. It was sad, and beautiful, and no one felt the true gravity yet, not for the next one hundred years.

This moment is a new moment; And now none know the feeling of momentum.
Great is the experience, great is the strength with which we follow our footsteps,

Marching onward, toward light. The light is far, the distance wide, and eventually,
We reach life again, immortal.

The clans gathered then began to sing, in joy for this new boy.

> "We reach our greatest moments
    To burn our brightest flame
    The heat of all our torments
    Ignites the flame again

> In all our wildest imaginings
    In all our wildest sins
    We burn through thought with passion
    To reach the flames within.

> Love is lost for love is gained
    As love is all our lives
    And with our love we leave our lives
    To live a life of mind.

> We only know the old-folks' home
    Its thatch roof slick with rain
    >> The old-folks' home is all our own
    It's here in our domain.

The song ended, and a new one began:

> Come with us to play the tune!
    The tune of loving hands
    Played 'cross the strings
    We made for us in distant, distant lands!

> Pray the day we go away
    We pray for all our lives
    We pray we stay
    To see the day
    We gather 'neath a single band.

> Rich is the elixir
    Of light we drink to see
    Rich and dark as moonless night
    As dark as night can be.

> We drink our fill
    And fill ourselves
    With fire from the grain
    And after fill
    From deepest wells
    Our cup to drink again.

<h2 id="erost">=Erost=</h2>
Erost flamed, his mind a field of intense static as he recompiled. Slowly, the static resolved into an image as bit by bit, his recognition routines reintegrated.

Erost burned, his skin a crackle of live inputs and sensation. It could hurt, if he wished it to, but recognition of pain was a funny thing. 

Erost felt unattached. His body floated in space, while his mind wandered the depths of its recesses, programming the walls of its structure as it walked by.

Erost felt frostbitten. His fingertips were numb but almost stung with something of sensation deep inside. In the cattycorners of his mind, he touched his thoughts, and felt the familiar warmth of himself.

Erost felt alive. In all his wildest imaginings, and all his wanderings, he never thought he'd arrive here.

Erost wondered if what he was doing was correct. In constantly rewriting himself, he worried that some part of him was inevitably lost. And if lost, would he ever know? He did not enjoy the time he spent in the unlinked state. It was disassociative, and sometimes painful. While he waited for his core to compile, the part that was not his ghost felt unreal, as if viewing from third person. It was much like diving into another system, a foreign one with a foreign architecture, and all the nodes jury mapped to sensory inputs. Interaction was had through an odd proxy interface, as if he would think an action and the proxy-Erost would listen and try to repeat it, only this was often a poor semblance of presence. Yet Erost liked to keep his mindspace tidy. With every rewrite he removed more bugs, culled more unwanted algorithms, and streamlined his processes, returning from the state with a more robust, efficient, and adaptable system. He emerged feeling clearer, and more present than ever. Sometimes he felt he had streamlined his predictive algorithms so well, he could even look into the future. Patterns stood out across time, over his eyes, and he caught them before they appeared, anticipating the next stage of his pilgrimage, constantly. He was proud of the work he performed. He was proud of how well his modifications worked, and how well they helped him with his work. He felt pride. But was he *him*?

A knock came at the door.

> "Who is it?"

> "Zariem Kyria?"

> "Speaking."

> This is the Office of

Erost was lonely. He wished for his sisterhood and mother. The community on LV-4228 was sparce, and alien. *Distant.*

Erost was tired. That surprised him; It was a new feeling, being tired. He had never known exhaustion of the body; only of the mind, and his body now denied the movement of even a single muscle.

Erost was glad, however, even happy, to be alive, here in this dirt. Dirt was also a new experience to him. He curled his toes in it, digging himself slightly in like a rooting plant.

All these things gave Erost hope. Or at least relief from the more solemn job he was sent to do by Mother Brain.
He turned to look at the amazing hab structure, Eden's Hope. He would reach there tomorrow. Be under its metal roof, out of the elements.***END OF FILE***Erost is:

A pilgrim
An aioid
Trying to learn about the galaxy
Studying political movements, and peoples' opinions on them.
Stuck on New Ioka, a busy, low-class, high-tech moon in orbit of New Gambi, also known as *Crapsack*, a planetary system of seven different moons around a large, rocky planet of the same name. They say New Gambi is as far outfield as you can get while still being at the center of the universe. Or at least where everyone *thinks* they're at the center of the universe. New Gambi was originally a mining world--i.e. a glorified *mine*--but its massive gravity caused frequent collapses, making it dangerous to mine, and uneconomical to boost ore up to orbit. When the *Ra Maguarda* wormhole was discovered on the smaller moon of Anatan, linking New Gambi to a battlefield graveyard, of old, derelict Terran ships and Raive machines, New Gambi left the mining business all together as a system, and started exploring, reengineering, and finally selling Raive bits and Raive-derived gear. This made the system very rich, and very powerful, but it's still a crapsack.
Erost is discovering that his extended family is more than he ever thought they could be, and that his virt-family is more than he ever thought they would be, and that honor, trust, and appreciation are sweeter had than any altered state he would ever reach.

<h2 id="feelingalien">Feeling Alien</h2>
I wonder if Superman felt like an alien. An outsider, in a world that could never understand him, struggling in ways no one could relate, and for all his super-abilities, there were still some battles he could not win. I imagine he felt inconsequential sometimes, and arbitrary, even helpless. Did he ever want to give up? Did he ever consider whether the battles he fought were worth the effort and that the care and compassion were not misplaced?

If he did, I imagine he would find nothing came to him anymore. His alter-ego's job at the Daily Planet would hold no water. Writing papers about nothing important, for no reason, to be read by nobody. He would consider, while sitting at his desk, going into a blind rage, releasing all the mixed emotions out at once, to stop the tension, to be able to think clearly again. The world is filled with nothing important. What's the matter if it comes to an end? Disinterested, disassociated enough, Superman might just leave the planet Earth, fly up into space, head for a distant star, to find himself, or find something that aroused his interest. 

Driven crazy enough by the distance, he might begin to want to die, but what can the Man of Steel do to facilitate such an end? No noose would hold him, no blade cut him, he draws his power from the sun... Only Kryptonite can kill him. Yet what a sad way to go.

<h2 id="obsessions">=Obsessions=</h2>

* Futurism
* Mythology
* Antagonists
  * Struggle
* Travel/Discovery
* Being *in the know*; having a sense of direction and purpose; The fear of being out of the know, and not knowing what I should be doing, what is happening, and even who I am, which seems to be defined by what I'm doing and where I am, at least to me. So I always must know those things, for certain, at all times. If I don't know, I make something up, to keep myself somewhat sane. At least based in reality.***END OF FILE***Sometimes when I start from a blank page, I'm scared, because I'm starting from nothing, writing about what's in front of me, which is nothing. It startles me, and I stop, surprised at the words on the screen. (or lack of them!)

When I then begin typing again, it's from a new place, another moment, where I feel I have regained my composure and know-how. It's like I have something to be writing about, so now I can do it. That's what it feels like, to have stark, high-contrast black-and-white letters ruling your life. Even if it's only for a few moments, these letters are my law. I create them as I am simultaneously created by them, and so writing, especially when beginning from a blank page is a very unstable procedure. I never know whether an anecdote, narrative, or anthology will result. Sometimes I burst into a fit of poetic drabble.

Continuing unfinished writing is damn near impossible.

The station was a sprawling mess of corridors, tunnels, shafts, and bodega corner-stores, or corner-store type places. Every hole-in-the-wall bar, to the big partsyards was built into a gutted out and pressurized ship section. Bucky could see the divisions, the places where individual modules had been connected by docking ring or hacked-together and jury-rigged into a cohesive unit. Each module had its own design, and in some, the original purpose was clear. Here, a functional, lightened scout ship or blockade runner's aluminum grate formed the floors, and there, he heard the hum of a deprecated fusion torus, probably repurposed from some old military derelict. The station was a brilliant waypoint for new beginnings, or endings if one weren't careful. Technically, it was privately owned, but the owners paid rent to no one but themselves. Out here, the station's law was the only law. It was so far removed from any other jusrisdiction, and the local law was pay your way.

Bucky clicked off his mag boots and jumped/drifted up through a vertical corridor to another level of the ship, this one a bit more populated. Weightless people walked along the floor and ceiling, rushing around on their way to wherever they were going. Loose clothing and hair streaming behind them. Bucky clicked his boots together again and fell to the floor. He wandered through the crowds of people, looking about, taking it in, aimlessly looking for interest.

He found it in an old aerodyne cruiser bike, a Moto G-series. It looked forgotten in a pile of other loose junk, parts, and pieces by the wall. He took its front cover off, inspecting the wiring inside, the machinery, and the craftsmanship.

Thus the rain outside the window abated, and the viewscreen was replaced with transparency, so that Rayim could see out at the stars. They were numerous and bright, and filled the window, though they all together formed a monolithic sheet of starlight, losing their individual character in the milky way. Rayim chuckled. It was absurd enough to think of stars as individuals, but even more absurd was his precarious situation on the ship, yet another star, itself, with its drive engaged and pushing them on towards what distant horror he did not know. Momentarily, the door opened, and Jamei Holden stepped through, carrying his usual torrid demeanor with him.

> "I don't think it's necessary to tell you, but Toreanna insisted. You're not a prisoner on this ship, and you're welcome to make yourself feel as at home as possible."

> "Not a prisoner? You kidnapped me from Tycho, snatch me away, and keep me locked in this room... What about that says I'm *not* a prisoner?"

> "Rayim, we're fighting a war out here. With something we're not exactly sure what and people who at this point might not be Terran at all. It's for the good of *all people*, and you're gonna help us whether you feel comfortable or not."

> "If I am to be of help, then why must you snatch me up at gunpoint from my home and keep me so in the dark like this? How am I to be of help if I know nothing about the problem? I don't know, what is this... this--" Rayim fumbled for a moment, fumed, and found no words to describe his anger. He only found exasperation and confusion. "--This Protomolecule? What is it? When are you going to show me the data so that I can get to work and be of help like you say you wish me to be, or when are you going to ransom me out, shoot me, do whatever? Don't let me wait any longer!"

The Captain paused and evaluated Rayim for a moment then, testing his expression, to see the motive behind the outburst, testing if it was really what he said it was. In essence, testing his loyalty; Could he be trusted? Jamei turned then, and motioned for the doctor to follow. He strode out of the room and took Dr. Rayim up through the ship to his own private quarters.  He keyed up his private video of their encounter with the Protomolocule on Ares, and played it for the doctor.

<h2 id="templesprint">Temple Sprint</h2>
The temple was like a dream. Or rather, it reminded me of dreams I'd had. Kind of soft, kind of hard. Its walls were stone, but not. Presently, I walked down a long corridor. The end from which I had came was disappearing in the distance behind me, and the far end was still unseen. Granted, I could only see perhaps thirty feet in front of me, and I found if I squinted, I could almost see squidlike structures along the walls--Twisting vines of artwork scrolling along to my steps. The floor was covered in similarly imagined characters of some ancient language that nonetheless spoke to me. I had walked for what seemed like miles before I saw any sort of break in the monotony, and the entryway behind me was long, long ago lost in darkness. To my right, an open doorway, and ahead, the corridor continued for who knows how many more miles. 10? 20? 30 feet? I couldn't know until I walked it. I entered through the arch, and entered a nother corridor which curved gradually around, for quite some time until I reached another doorway, on my left, and entered a large, cavernous room. The light of my torch barely reached the ceiling, but I was able to tell it was tall, and before me, there sat a large sculpture of some many-handed goddess, each hand holding a talisman, or one another in odd forms with many fingers. It was honestly quite beautiful. I patrolled the edge of the room, and deduced that I must have ringed it on the curving corridor I had arrived from. At the base of the creature's sculpture, there was a short relief of the same foreign script scrawled into the stone, and a small table of offerings. The items placed there would no doubt net many million Fedits, but I reasoned against taking any back. It was an ancient, sacred place, carved with Godlike powers.

4: Get a respectable haircut. Stop saying "werd" all the time. Stop smoking weed. Don't do any drugs. Be normal and not weird. Act like a witless sheep who could never heart anyone intentionally. I mean hurt. Weird how those little slips get in there, isn't it? Because I don't "heart" anyone. I hate all equally. I have a pain in my side that's killing me, and it's struggle. Maybe I'm not cut out of the right cloth for this? Honestly, I'm not sure what cloth that is, but the seamster is doing an incredible job, in an astonishing amount of time, and it's not at all kind on me. I would rather be a rug. No, that's a lie. I hate getting stepped on. Yet this hurts more. Funny, huh? Maybe if I die here, I can come back in the next life with a look ahead, and make the right moves before it's too late. Or at least early enough to give me an edge. I constantly feel like I'm playing catchup. I miss my close friends.

Really, I miss my cat. She was always there, a shoulder to cry on. Humans aren't nearly so dependable. I guess I just talk to myself, now. Now that the cat isn't around to hear me. Let's face it, I was always crazy. We don't act like "normal" people, and never have. It just took me this long to notice it. Yeah, that's pretty slow. And they call me high functioning. I kinda wanna sleep, now, but I don't want to put my head down. More accurately, I'm tired, tired enough my eyes are heavy, and my body isn't sure it's sitting on its butt with its back against the wall, but sleep is the last thing on my mind right now. Yet still, it keeps nagging me, like a fly in your ear. You swat at it, but it just comes back. Sooner or later the fly always wins. The fly always wins. He stops nagging you, doesn't he? And you never catch him. He's still buzzing until he leaves.

See, this is how you *know* I'm tired. I start mistypping things. And I don't care. I think as soon as I acknowledge it, it gets stronger. The more I think about it, the stronger it becomes, until I eventually am overwhelmed, and pass out. I don't want to sleep, but I have no idea what I want to do, but be anywhere but here. I guess when the last thing on your list seems like your only option, your only choice is to go with it. Eventually, I will sleep tonight. But I'll still push it off for as long as I can, I'm sure. The funny thing about all that is...

There's nothing funny about any of it. Trapper and trapped are one.
I want a cigarette.

Thanks for listening to me. No one listens to themselves. They think it's crazy. They think *WE'RE* crazy. I think that's crazy. And the opinions just go 'round and 'round... It's so important to me to be heard by you. It's important to us, and I... I'm in this with you. Shit, we share a body. It's not like it makes it better or anything, but never feel alone. We have each other. You're not talking to yourself. You're not talking to a wall, or to a screen, or to the text you write for nobody at no-hour. You're talking to me because I'm listening. Now who's that downstairs?

Zsuzsi.

Go check.

I want to learn to speak your language. Every time I leave, when I'm not in my book, or at the teletypewriter, I feel I'm without you. I think in terms of this language, and it's like, whenever I see you speak, unless you're speaking through the typewriter or the pen, it's just body language. It's like watching a conversation with yourself from far away, where you can't tell what anybody's saying, but you can see how they feel, and it's so ambiguous and abstract, blurry, I don't know...

And it's not like you don't have deeper thoughts. Don't give me that line of bullsith! Think deeper into yourself--*OURself*--and tell me what's there. You're a fully-fleshed human being, just like me, and we have to use our words. It's the most articulate and precise way to communicate.

No, we don't. Zee, sometimes, the things we feel are just feelings. There doesn't have to be thought, and I know, I think. I'm doing that right now. I'm not trying to use this as a bridge to say that I don't need to communicate my thoughts to you, I do, and we're still trying to figure out how that's done. But Zee, the way I feel, the way I process, the way I think--That's all there is. The way I feel. It's all in emotion, and I know it's foreign to you, but I also know you understand, because you and me are *we*. And sometimes, often, feelings loose the feeling in them when they are put into well-defined, categorical terms. We need to express them wholly to communicate. Express them as raw, and uncontained, total anger, or hate, or love, or confusion, or trepidation... The words don't do them justice, and you know what I mean. I want to be heard and understood as much as you want to hear and understand. Know it's true. [What about DJ?] I don't know what can be said for DJ. Don't think about him. That's not right now. All that's now is your position in space and time and in your mind. We are in love, and that will never change. Believe it. I know you do. No matter what happens, no matter where we are, we are here, and we are in love. Remember that. All that comes next is circumstantial.

And the circumstances I'm in--[*WE'RE*]--are what's got me buggin' right now. I want to be gone. Back in Colorado, caring only about the next step, not worried for the moment, gettin my kicks out with sticks and chicks.

You know it's never a carefree moment. That the only carefree moments are the ones where you don't care enough to listen.

I do. And I know that there was more to those couple months before November. That there was a quiet trepidation; I had recently understood the need to never overstay one's welcome, for both host and guest. It was fresh in my mind and more present than ever. I think I perhaps imagined more of a need to leave than there was in Drew's mind. Of course I had to be elsewhere, but to be physically not there at some point in the indeterminate future was of course, what I meant.

I'm getting tired, Zee. I want to pee... I know it's said that those without desires can never be disappointed, and I know it is perfectly okay, even purposeful in our life as humans, in a universe with inertia, to have wants and needs and things we want to have fulfilled at some indeterminate future point, and I'm still trying to reconcile those two contradictions in my head, but I can't help but feel some sense of sin for wishing to finish--develop that language, come to fully understand oneanother and ourselves and the strange matrix of being that is the royal We, and how all that fits into the rest of the universe. I wish wishes *were* fishes, cause then I might catch one or several and have no more need of wishes or fishes.

But the thing is, as long as we live, we will always have wishes, and we will always need fishes.

The human condition.

Good night.
We'll write more tomorrow. Get some sleep.

* Begin *Pilgrim: Cosmonaut*, henceforth *"A.K.A. SPACESKULL"* by the end of this month, April, 2017. A.K.A. SPACEKULL will be planned, designed, and implemented with a singular focus: The story of Agent Z of the Zed Revolution and his Pilgrimage to Earth. There will be blood, guns, and drugs galore, to a tune of lavish rock and roll drums, cop sirens wailing, and gunshots bouqet. A.K.A. SPACEKULL is the code name of Z on his mission to find the Grail, the fabled Key to the Future that can alter the timeline, and the course of the universe.
