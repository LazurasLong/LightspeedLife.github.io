<p>If you build a beautiful box,<br>
    It is folly to leave it empty.</p>
<p>Zee Pilgrim is my stage name -- or was, for a time, something I had made up. My friends call me Zero, and now the name&#39;s made me. I created this website as a convenient and pretty way to showcase my writing and general artistry. And also to have a little fire under my butt -- Like my books saw more use as I filled them and they took on an almost transcendental appearance, so the website too might invite literature to be put in it.</p>
<p>I am a vagabond writer, gypsie traveller, sublime magician, maniac jack-of-trades. There&#39;s a long (endless) list of reasons why I write. Every writer has theirs, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get into it in another blog post. I already have several such essays in my red book. I love my Moms and I miss my cat. If we ever met, I&#39;d probably recommend you read &quot;Writing Down the Bones&quot; by Natalie Goldberg. In fact, you should go read it right now. You can order a paperback off amazon for five dollars, and read it in about an hour. The book will help you find the peace you&#39;re looking for, get the girl/job/redemption you want... It might even save your life. Really, it says so right on the back cover. Seriously, go pick it up and read it. I&#39;ll wait...</p>
<p>I started writing in earnest some time last year -- that is some time around the start of 2016. It feels new still, like a fresh pair of boots, but despite that, I&#39;ve done a lot of walking. Speaks more to the quality of the boots, than to the age of the walker, don&#39;t it? I started a long time ago, and I can still remember a few details from my first written piece. It was short, maybe as long as this page, but no longer, and my main character had just been raped. She was hanging naked by her wrists from the ceiling of a basement, and by the end of it she was covered in blood. Not hers, mind you. I was like 15, probably, and couldn&#39;t tell you now my motivations, thoughts, dreams, troubles, or tribulations behind it, but the image is hard to forget. Despite the subject, I got good praise from it. I remembered that and picked writing up again years down the road. Never did figure out how she got herself down from there. She was a strong female lead, and I was full of sexual frustration at being a virgin teen. When I started college, I went to study creative writing. I reasoned that if I were given assignments I would write more until I became a real writer. For my final project, I interviewed a real writer from the area. I can&#39;t remember much of what we talked about, but one thing stuck with me: We were talking about what makes a writer. He said that while everyone was going about their day, getting involved with this and that, the writer sat and watched. He wondered what they were doing, who they were doing it for, and how they were feeling. That, and he always ate his sandwiches with lots of mayonnaise because he had terrible cottonmouth. I never did read any of his work, though.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t keep up with the news or media much. I hear about movies and games and TV months after their release, and this is always interesting for ones that I&#39;m into because I get so excited afterward and bothered that I didn&#39;t get a hold of whatever it was back when it was new. (The most recent example was Mirror&#39;s Edge Catalyst, if memory serves, and I still can&#39;t play it cause its minimum requirements aren&#39;t met by my old, junky laptop). I didn&#39;t vote in this year&#39;s election. I don&#39;t know how to feel about Trump. My isolation is partially intentional. I ask three people about one thing in politics and get seven different answers back. It&#39;s maddening, so I&#39;ve learned to take no one at their word, no matter what evidence they give (Everyone&#39;s got some really really valid points about why they&#39;re right and everyone who doesn&#39;t agree is wrong. Even <em>YOU</em>. You can&#39;t <em>all</em> be right about everyone else being wrong). I&#39;ve decided to be uninvolved until I can find the time and interest to start doing my own research. Other projects frequently steal my focus, and this web site was one of them.</p>
