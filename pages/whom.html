    <p>I&rsquo;m Zee &ldquo;Zer0&rdquo; Pilgrim, AKA Samuel Petty and this is my blog.
    Do you like it? I made it myself. They didn&rsquo;t give me any
    direction on what to write here, so I&rsquo;m just going to keep
    going until he tells me to stop. Okay, I&rsquo;m a writer and a
    gypsie vagabond and when people ask me about my work I wish I had a
    convenient and fun way to show them. My book isn&rsquo;t always in
    view, so I&rsquo;m excited to put it all up on this blog and show
    people some of the more lengthy stuff I&rsquo;ve done on the
    computer. Also wow, my typing speed has gotten fast. I started
    writing in earnest only about a year ago, though I have written much
    since then. Stories, poems, and strange, unique bits of world design
    are all my forte. Wow, this is really lame. Remind me to delete this
    and rewrite it before we go live.</p>
