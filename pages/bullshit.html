This should be a freaking CAKEWALK if I can motivate myself to do it and remember that anything and everything goes in the book, so don't be shy about what you say. And then we can do it all again next month! Remember Questions and Answers. Always ask. If you don't know what to say ever, ask a question.<br>
<strong>&rsaquo;What will the book be about?</strong><br>
Vaguely, about future space-people decended from humans surviving in the 3rd millenium post-apocalypse. More specifically, I couldn't tell you at all. It might be one story with many plotlines, it might be a collection of shorts, it could be just a compendium of information on the world of There are no Terrans, like the Simarillion, but less dense and more strange, or anything inbetween or around. It may feature illustrations and sequential art, but my goal is still the 50,000 words, so any images would be a supplement, not a substitute for the novel.<br>
>Tell me something interesting -- What excites you about the project you are about to be undertaking?<br>
Well, I have to admit I have a lot of anxiety about it, and I don't want to search to hard for something to get excited about, so I'd have to say it's my characters. I'm excited to see how they fare out. I have this one named Zuriya who is being chased by something sinister and tenacious. My Aphrodite -- Astoyy is a constant mystery to me. She doesn't tell me much about herself, though she interacts the most with me on a meta-level. The other characters don't interject so much when they come up in my train of thought or conversation. In my honest opinion, it's vanity. Astoyy is undoubtedly a very vain character, if nothing else. But she needs to loosen her lips and give me some story material soon or she might not make it into the book! Koko is yet another strong female character. I've drawn her a few times, and those illustrations are here on my site. She's an explorer. Think, "Sci-Fi Tomb Raider." Then there's the artist from "Man on Edge." I have to finish that story. Maybe it'll go in the book.<br>
<br>
To be honest, my greatest concern with writing the book on time is that I won't be able to say anything other than "I hate my life I want it to stop this is painful!" And while that's fine and true and all, I don't want this book to become a pity-fest. I don't want my writing in general to be a pity-fest. To be pitiful. So I put on a smile while I scribble. It is one thing that generally makes me want to smile, anyway. I hope that for the next month at least, I will have the insight to break through that cry for help to the meat of what it is I am trying to say, or at least focus enough to write about anything else.</p>

    <p><a href="sarahtoga.jpg"><img src="sarahtoga.jpg" alt="sarahtoga.jpg. it's a pun because she cried like the saratoga springs but she did it to herself so fuck her." style="width: 400px; height: auto; float: right"></img></a>Another day, another bullshit post. I can't remember if I got one in yesterday, or if it was the day before, and it was the first one. Ha, That's neat. Anyway, today I want to talk about people and their bullshit, so this is the perfect column to be posting in. When people start drama and act like fuckwits for no good reason, it's always a cry for help. And that's why, as someone who experiences and expresses his own bullshit from time to time -- no I often give people hell -- I can sympathize, and I see that when people are giving off bullshit, they're suffering, just like me. What they're saying, or trying to, without using the words that do it, is, "WUBALUBADUBDUB SPLIT WRISTS IN THE TUB LIFE SUCKS AND I'M FULL OF PAIN PLEASE HELP ME!" It's what I'd be saying if I didn't use words, too. But I shouldn't have sympathy.  We all wish someone would give a shit about our bullshit, even though it's just as pointless and probably half as painful as half of everyone elses', it hurts more to suffer alone. You are all intolerable, even you, yes, you, dear reader. But your absence is so much more intolerable, it's painfully uncomfortable. I starve for genuine human connection in this sea of clones, and yet, I drive myself mad without you. It is time to wake up. I'm the youngest little brother on Christmas morning, bored, gone bonkers, waiting for all yall to wake up so we can play and get on with the day. It's beautiful out, the ground is ripe for adventure. Yall stuck inside, dreaming. You can't interface with reality, so I'm here alone, on this beach, building sand castles by myself. You whisper in and out of my ear, never truly present, never solidly engaged. You have to use your clutch. Lock in, gear up with me. Let's drive this life together, all a part of the machine, when we want to be, fully aware.</p>

    <h3>Oct. 19, '17 @ 6:30 AM</h3>
    <p>Ah, geez. I get all this way and I can&#39;t think of what to write.</p>
    <p>Well, sorry I&#39;ve been away so long. I shouldn&#39;t let it go nearly a month between updates. Hence: Bullshit. Named such &#39;cause that&#39;s what it <em>is</em>. Bullshit is a new column on my page I&#39;ve created for the basic purpose of keeping me actively engaged with the site. The goal is to write something, no matter what garbage it might be, even if I just talk about my toenails and how they should be hooves instead of stubby, stub-your-toeable toenails, or some other such nonsense. Essentially, I need a babysitter.</p>
    <p>Anyway, on to the topic of why I&#39;ve been so ghost lately: Next month is NaNoWriMo November, which I have pledged to be a part of. I intend to be the best part, the author of my very own novel, which will be my best novel EVER! And also my only novel as of yet, so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m shouting for. God, it&#39;s late, and I should be in bed. I&#39;m getting wiggy. In any event, I&#39;ll be setting it in my gargantuan universe of There Are No Terrans, which I haven&#39;t mentioned yet on this site, but I should do an article on soon, as it&#39;s basically where everything you&#39;ve ever read of mine takes place. EVEN THIS, RIGHT NOW. Indeed, meta-fiction is an aspect of the universe, what with me as its dreamer and simulation hardware. To the end that my first novel be halfway decent or at least finished, I&#39;ve been plotting and scheming and building a story with people and places and drama and things of that type since the start of October. I won&#39;t be caught with my pants down like I was with my trial run! But that&#39;s the point of trials, anyway. But there is another thing which has been taking my time, and unfortunately that of the book, but it is a parallel endeavour, so I let myself slide... I&#39;m turning No Terrans into a comic book. Yes! Although you&#39;re only just hearing about this amazing new world, I&#39;m already giving you special bonus graphic content to feast your soon-to-be ravenous minds on! On the other hand, you&#39;re more likely one of my family or
    <a href="playing_wik.jpg"><img src="playing_wik.jpg" alt="my first TanT-unrelated sketch on the new computer" style="height: 200px; width: auto; float: left;"></img></a>
    friends since this website is <strong>still</strong> <em>hella ninja</em>, in which case you&#39;ve heard me go on for decades about TanT so I&#39;ll just stop right here. And there you have it: Why it took me three weeks to finally post something new here. Next time I&#39;ll aim for a reasonable time of day, too. I just don&#39;t write readable stuff this late at night. 6:30 bedtime is way too late for a grown old man like me. Like I said -- babysitter. So check out the first Non-No Terrans related sketch I did on the new computer. I learned to sketch like this on acid and it's been a staple ever since. Okay it's light out nightnightnow.</p>
