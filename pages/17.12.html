  	<p>This is the state of my previous Every Day Carry blackbook, the red one. You can see it's tattered, and well-abused, and although you can't see it in the picture, the pages have separated from the cover as one whole chunk. In addition, I had no apparent concept of organization when I made this notebook, so it's become really, really hard to find anything I put in there. It was time for an upgrade.</p>
  	<p>I was doing some research on stationery when I stumbled upon the <todo>Midori Traveler's Notebook</todo>, a simple, functional, aesthetically gorgeous patch of leather with a strip of elastic through it, through which one can insert softcover paper booklets in a use-it-as-you-need-it system that I realized I could use to cut down the waste and inefficiency in my current notebook system, and then I discovered <todo>Bullet Journaling</todo>, but that Traveler's system sells online for $60! And you only get one insert included and it's on this irregularly-sized paper that forces you to buy their own, the leather cover is much too small for the small, commonplace <i>library</i> I carry arround in my pockets daily, and yadda yadda yadda, I thought I could save money by making my own, and I totally could! I probably spent a little more than I could've for a midori from Traveler's company, or one of the 'Faux-doris' at say Michaels, but I got something that's much more customized to my tastes, and about 300 sheets of dots printed on very nice paper for about $30 at a print shop in boulder, which is a great deal, considering the inserts go for about $10 an insert. I'm glad to be thrifty.</p>
    <p>So I got all my materials together, and I figured, "Hey, I might as well make my own leather dye, too, since dyes can be a bit obtuse about explaining exactly what was in the bottle, and I didn't want to chance damaging my nice leather (Which I did anyway, but more on that later), so I dumped a can of coffee in a big stock pot with some rusty nails and things, following <todo>this guide</todo> on the internet, let it reduce for a few days, and--presto! I have dye!</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, all didn't go as planned. Though I admit it was my first time doing <i>any</i> sort of leatherwerk, I can't help but kick myself a little bit over these simple mistakes: I didn't leave them in long enough, and I put them in with the metal bits, which scratched long marks in the surface of the gorgeous piece of leather I bought for my notebook. I'm hoping that the scratches will stand out less as the cover wears in, and I reckon I can dye it again once I get more coffee, so it's no big deal, just little things to find disappointment in.</p>

      <figcaption>You can see the scratches here. There's bigger ones on the back.</figcaption>

    <p>I've been so excited for this project since I came close to finishing my old black book. If my notebooks are supposed to reflect my inner self, then I'm not looking so good. I know that this new tool can be a framework from which to build off of and improve my outlook and life, which is the real thing that I'm excited for. The paper is rewarding in its own way, but it's the system, which I can use to examine life from new angles, the hope is, with better clarity. That's what really fascinates me here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I mentioned Bullet Journaling earlier, and when I say tool, I mean this too. I can tell that the system is a natural extension of my own writing methods, with perhaps different but similar conclusions. Well, all I can say is I'm excited. That's all. And that though NaNo is over I'm glad to be feeling like I've learned a lot about my creative process, and I'm excited to do it again soon.</p>
