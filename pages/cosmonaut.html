##First Writing<br/>
<br/>
Mayra looked out the port window as the dust settled around her shuttle. Soft landing it was not, but it was not an issue right now. Turbulent winds had taken her out of the sky, but the shuttle's major systems still showed green. It would get her back up to the mother craft with her payload, and she could have it repaired later. For now, the sun was bright and beautiful, the air toxic, and the ground radiating low levels of ions. Garden world it was not, but there was treasure here, no doubt. All the Fall Worlds had leftovers from the old civilization. A hundred years old or more, if it survived the war, and nobody had got to it first. She grabbed her tools and her gun and looked toward the horizon. Her helmet told her the prospective ruins she had marked were close -- perhaps a half-hour's walk away over difficult terrain. The hill was the first challenge. She had landed on such a slope that it was trouble enough just to stand upright. It was easier to crawl sideways on all fours in most places, though then her satchel threatened to get away from her. Slinging it over her shoulder made little difference, as it so imbalanced her that she fell a few times, tumbling inconveniently, but gently down the slope. The lack of any sort of flora or moisture made the ground too loose to hold her boots. The end result was that no matter what she did, she kept slipping until she was walking along the canyon floor. Her destination was a bit farther off now, with the sun now at zenith, and creeping slowly, but visibly toward the horizon. To her left and right, the red dirt walls rose high overhead. Far behind her, her craft lay on its side, braced from slipping into the gulf with her by the only outcropping of rock on that hillside. Ahead, the canyon narrowed into deep arroyos as it gradually climbed back to her previous elevation. She figured she had perhaps another hour or two to go, now.<br/>
<br/>
The sun was three quarter's through the sky now, and she passed the time humming belter rovers as she walked. She could see the ruins on the horizon now, and little remnants of what was once a settlement or a city. So much was rubble by this point it was hard to know for certain. Larger, more durable structures still stood in the distance, and it was in these that she held the most hope for salvage. The sky had gone from a sandy brown to a darker orange, with purple, whispy clouds. Fast high-altitude winds sent them dancing across the sky, puffing and twisting into new forms as the seconds passed. The sun cast long shadows off them, and as they passed over her she felt no chill through the skin of her vacsuit. They were so beautiful and animated, then. Perhaps the most animated thing on this world besides herself. Thermal and terahertz-ray scans prior to landing had showed no signs of life. If there was anything on this world besides herself, it was either microbial in size or too strange to be considered life as we know it. She huffed along, climbing over rubble and dirt only distinguishable as ruins by color from the surrounding terrain. As she walked further, the ruins began to appear closer together, some with a wall still standing, or a bit of floor showing. She realized she was walking down city streets. Every now and then, a metal post, too rusted to guess at its meaning, marked an intersection. Here and there, other scraps told of a city which once had people. Nearer the center of the ruined city, the buildings provided more protection for each other from the elements, and more still stood. She looked through windows at dust-covered ancient settings. Familiar scapes juxtaposed with odd, broken devices, whos natures she could only guess at. A table here, with chairs, and in the center, a flowerish metal disc. In another ruin, a metal alcove in the wall, the size of a standup shower, with no apparent interface or moving parts. On closer inspection, it seemed to be all one piece of metal, with no seams of any kind! It was corroded and brittle, and disintegrated to the touch. The ruins were filled with odd, broken things like this. She left via a collapsed wall, and continued down the street. Deep shadows covered the streets, and the sky above had turned a mix of dark reds and deep purple. Ahead in the distance, she could see peeking over the tops of the ruins a tall spire. It caught the last light of the sun and glinted with it. She decided to rest for the few hours until sunup, and make her way to the spire by the light of morning. She tucked into a nearby ruin, and began to practice the hibernation techniques her Ambaiss ancestry had given her. Quoamm, the protected space to calm the mind and establish wards, Gungmuir, to still the body and lessen its needs, and Liufta, to nurture and rejuvinate the resting spirit. She would remain alert, but in a dreamlike trance until morning, when her body would resume its natural functions. Until then, her body would consume a minimum of oxygen while focusing her psychic abilities for the next day.<br/>
<br/>
The next few hours passed for Mayra with the sense of a turbulent haze. Where she had expected peaceful calm, her dreams were filled with tendrils of thick, curling purple smoke drifting through her wards, though when she reached out her perceptions to detect what was there, she found nothing, only opaque emptiness, as if her, and the immediate space around her were floating in an unknowable place, without down or up or side-to-side. She sometimes felt like she was tumbling, and sometimes felt like she was the only permanent thing, while the world tumbled around her. More than once she had the distinct sensation that someone or several someones were walking through her wards, and would stop to talk to her in a language that, much stranger than being unable to understand, she couldn't hear. The words were garbled and muffled as if heard from across a great distance and spoken by many different people at once, out of unison. She had the feeling that someone was calling out to her, but she was unable to help, not knowing where, or when she was, and who was calling and for what. When dawn finally arrived, and she opened her eyes, she looked around at the ruined city structures, at the dusted, rotted, and broken things. There was a dense, low fog hanging over the streets, just obscuring the ground. She was pleased to find that she had drained very little of her oxygen reserves during the night, though she felt as exhausted as if she had spent the few hours of night wandering the city, lost. She remembered almost nothing of her dream trance. Only the sense of disorientation and a foggy image of smoke like clouds in the night sky. She stood up and looked toward the tower, its spire now reflecting the light of the morning, far brighter and dazzling, though no less mystical in the night. She realized it must be one of the ancient temples of which she had heard! When, before the Great War, and the fall of Terra, the ancients had worshipped great technological constructs with incredible powers. These temples were the holy grail of Fall Worlds. To think that she would find one on her first hunt! She started down the road toward the tower with vigor and determination, to crack open the ancient secrets there and bring back wealth and status to her embassy.<br/>

##Second Writing<br/>
<br/>
Under the light of dawn, she could see clearly the ruins as she passed, and to her astonishment, many of the buildings still stood tall. Covered in dust though they were, their interiors were intact, and given a little bit of imagination, felt as though they could still be lived in by the ancient people who once called this home. She entered a few. Once, after stepping through an open doorway, she thought she saw lights on one of the many unidentified metallic devices she had seen. It turned out to be a trick of the light, seeping in at such an angle through the windows, but she found that the reflection of the sun off the instrument was because it was pristine; uncorroded. It occured to her that perhaps here, near the heart of the city, erosion by wind and rain could not take as hard a toll on the buildings as on the outskirts, and without animals to take residence, it was likely that many of the buildings here were as untouched as this one, and contained items as intact as the one she held. Despite being whole, it offered no more clues to its use than any of the other instruments she had found. This one was a thin, flat disc, metallic, like all the others in texture and appearance, and without seams or expressions or markings of any kind. It looked like a plate. Perhaps it was only intended to be eaten off of. She stowed it anyway in her satchel.<br/>
<br/>
The spire now stood high over the other buildings, and it became apparent how tall it really was to be seen from the outskirts of the city, and how large the city was to make it seem like a speck that only glinted over the tops of the other buildings from its edge. The base of it was large, but not massive as she expected -- It was only about a quarter the size of the city blocks she had passed. -- though it was set in an artistic display of architechture to which a whole block was dedicated. Raised terraces and large, flat geometric spaces formed intricate shapes in front of and surrounding the structure. Perhaps at one time, they formed an elaborate garden. Now, centuries of dirt and sand covered them. The base of the spire began at a pyramid, whos trunk gradually stretched upwards, like a huge needle poking the fabric of the stars. Though the base was choked with sand, the tip gleamed in the mid-day sun, and swayed slightly in the gusting currents that pushed green clouds across the sky. She stared in amazement for several moments at its beauty. It was perfect. Every curve and line in the whole arrangement harmonized in perfect geometry. After a while, she went in.<br/>
<br/>
The doors
 were massive, and constructed of something that centuries of disuse and exposure to the elements couldn't cause to creak.<br/>
<br/>
//Why do I feel so badly that she wants to say something here? What are you trying to say?<br/>
<br/>
Inside was unlit, but the metal walls, though not mirror-like, reflected so much light that just the small crack from the doorway was enough to illuminate the entire interior. Before her, leading down to a corridor on the next level were a set of wide stone steps. Her whole body felt alive and alert. Electric. Her skin prickled, and she felt a vitality she had not noticed she lacked since earlier that morning. It was the utter incredulity of the moment! Walking inside a structure that for generations, had been empty. The thought that the last feet to step here had long since turned to dust was almost too much to comprehend. She grinned. Excited, she started down the wide stone steps into the temple. The corridor she walked along was inscribed with reliefs of what was presumably history, and runes in a language she had never seen nor heard of in any history document, yet looked familiar, like something from a dream, or vision. She got a sense of the gravity and direction of the text, right off the wall, by the almost pictographic style of writing, and the juxtaposition of the relief images. To her, it seemed to tell a story of birth and death, and rebirth, and death again in every phrase. She took it in, but didn't ponder long. To her, it was foreign and incomprehensible.<br/>
<br/>
She walked on, past the reliefs, into a large temple area. Here was a massive, cavernous room, almost too big to fit inside the base of the spike, and she hadn't realized she'd decended so far underground already. She looked to the ceiling, to see where the light was coming from, and realized the ceiling was transparent! She was directly under the spike, as blue light streamed down and filled in the shadows. At the far end of the tall room, a strange figure sculpture stood as tall as the ceiling. It was roughly human in form, but wiry, and fluid, as if crafted from streams of milk. The armor or clothes it wore flowed about in beautiful symmetry. Alien, but full of humanity at the same time. As she walked around it, she noticed another set of hands, connected to arms below the usual first set. The hands connected in mudra like the mudra of ambaiss rituals, though this shape was foreign to her, and formed with an odd number of fingers. She pondered its use, and admired its beauty. It looked like an interlaced braid of vines, and atop, a flower or bud of some sort. Though the particular pattern was strange, vines and flowers were a common appearance for a mudra to have. The figure stood tall. In one right hand, it held a trident. The other left was outstretched, palm down, over a spot on the floor. One finger loosely pointed across to a sigil, like a name or message of some sort. She stepped over to the spot. It was dark, so dark that it seemed to swallow the shadow cast by the hand above it. She dipped the corner of her bag into it, and found it was hollow. Shining a light in only revealed the lip of the hole; Beyond was still dark. She removed a length of rope and a carabiner, and tied them together into a makeshift grappel, which she tossed around the outstretched finger of the hand above her. Holding her breath, holding the rope, she slipped into the hole. As soon as she had passed to the other side, she was suspended in a ray of light, from floor to ceiling. The room was visible, now, bathed in the golden column that encased her. Gravity pulled less hard, and glints of silver drifted up around her as she hung from the rope. Gently, gradually, she released her grasp. The light caught her, and carried her softly down to the next level. She tugged twice on the rope, and the SmartHook released its catch, and gently followed her from the ceiling. She looked around. As she did, her hair swished around inside her helmet, like snow stirring gently in a snow globe. The walls were shorter, yet no less grandiose in their decorations than the cathedral above. She was at the end of a long hallway, standing in a circle, up from which still came the pillar of light. Cautiously, she stepped out of the circle. It was like walking underwater, or through jelly. The light ceased the moment the last of her foot had left the circle, but the room remained lit by the shining spot on the ceiling, as well as from the walls themselves, which gave off more of a subtle glow, than any incandesence. She felt fear and excitement all at once. Trepidation. She realized now, she was really inside an ancient relic from far before her or her father's time. She realized that for better or worse, she was inside, now. She stepped back into the circle. The light returned. She fished in the pockets of her vacsuit, and tossed a 10-note chit upward, towards the ceiling, through the column. It floated upward, and kept going at an even pace toward the hole she had decended from. She stepped out of the circle, the light vanished, and she caught the chit as it fell.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; *Good. It serves to ascend, as well. I should remember to be more cautious, going forward.*<br/>
<br/>
The hallway extended toward an open space. Towards the end, 3 sets of doors faced each other, though they had no handles, knobs, buttons, or switches to open them, and they did not budge when pushed. Their frames were carved reliefs of characters in action: One holding a tool of some sort to another, one standing in a field, another teaching a mass. The hallway opened into another large room. This one, a large circle, framed with more doors. The door she left, the vaginal opening between a statue's legs. Her hands also joined in mudra, thumb and fingers touching tips, forming a portal. Her body was solid, dark stone, her eyes pearlecent crystals. As Mayra backed into the center of the room, The eyes glowed, taking in all of Mayra, and consuming her in the light of understanding. To Mayra, the statue simply stirred, as if restless, and the eyes gave the sensation of shifting slightly, like a vidscreen switching between pictures. The stone breathed softly, humming with life. Atop the figure's head rest a crown, and in the center, a bud, like that of an artichoke. Mayra turned and examined the doors around her. There were many to chose from, and unlike the six in the hallway she had left, these had no reliefs to distinguish them. There were seven doors.***END OF FILE***
