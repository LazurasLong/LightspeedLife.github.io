	<h1>Nov. 30th, 11:30pm: 30m to NaNo deadline</h1>
<br>
<p>Wow, so I got so consumed by NaNo I didn't post to the website in a month. I suppose that's a good thing. I'm gonna try to take it as one. I don't think I wrote 50'000 words in the last 30 days, though it is time-consuming to count, as I write almost entirely longhand, and must transcribe my illegibly fine print before running *wc*. <figure style="float: right;"><img style="height:200px; width: auto;" src="messydesk.jpg" alt="messydesk.jpg"><figcaption>The state of my desk right now</figcaption></figure> I have nonetheless written at a quite ferocious pace, and accumulated a great deal of scribbled-up pages in my Black Books. In addition, loose papers fill my office, covered in dense scrawl or ink prints. There are volumes here. The thought that I might collect and finilize, beautify, and legibify them in some sort of structured codex, as a final, publishable book.</p>
<br>
<p>It is also important to finish a work, and then keep making more; not to stay with the past too long. So that is what I will do.</p>
<br>
<p>This last month has taught me about next steps: Arranging my life so that I don't feel lost. I know where I am and where I'm going because I know where my next step is, and I remember my last. As far as next steps go, one thing I really <i>must</i> do is redo my website. I am thinking of perhaps using jekyll to make things easier on me, but regardless--big layout changes, and maybe I can make this look good on <i>everyone's</i> device, and most importantly, I'll be adding more images. I need to break up the space--the expansive black field of hyperspace. There is a point where it's too much fuzz. As a matter of fact, that's one of the main reasons for this splash post. The other is I need sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>I've started doing suminagashi paper marbling as well, which is very enjoyable, and I will post scans tomorrow when I go back and recalibrate the scanner because the constrast is terrible.</p>

<p>Also, I bought a piece of leather and my mom bought me a bunch of art supplies so I'm going to make myself a Fauxdori. My current notebook has just about run out of pages, and it is literally falling apart. It took me a year to do it but I think it's beat. It taught me a lot--this last year, one important thing of which is that I'm still learning. Stay sharp, 0. But it's a very pretty piece of leather, and I'm excited to make my new book, so I will post pics of that on the way, along with more art and things that I do. Alright Goodnight.</p>
