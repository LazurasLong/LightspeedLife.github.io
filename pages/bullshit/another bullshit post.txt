Another day, another bullshit post. I can't remember if I got one in yesterday, or if it was the day before, and it was the first one. Ha, That's neat. Anyway, today I want to talk about people and their bullshit, so this is the perfect column to be posting in. When people start drama and act like fuckwits for no good reason, it's always a cry for help. And that's why, as someone who experiences and expresses his own bullshit from time to time -- no I often give people hell -- I can sympathize, and I see that when people are giving off bullshit, they're suffering, just like me. What they're saying, or trying to, without using the words that do it, is, "WUBALUBADUBDUB SPLIT WRISTS IN THE TUB LIFE SUCKS AND I'M FULL OF PAIN PLEASE HELP ME!" It's what I'd be saying if I didn't use words, too. But I shouldn't have sympathy.  We all wish someone would give a shit about our bullshit, even though it's just as pointless and probably half as painful as half of everyone elses', it hurts more to suffer alone. You are all intolerable, even you, yes, you, dear reader. But your absence is so much more intolerable, it's painfully uncomfortable. I starve for genuine human connection in this sea of clones, and yet, I drive myself mad without you. It is time to wake up. I'm the youngest little brother on Christmas morning, bored, gone bonkers, waiting for all yall to wake up so we can play and get on with the day. It's beautiful out, the ground is ripe for adventure. Yall stuck inside, dreaming. You can't interface with reality, so I'm here alone, on this beach, building sand castles by myself. You whisper in and out of my ear, never truly present, never solidly engaged. You have to use your clutch. Lock in, gear up with me. Let's drive this life together, all a part of the machine, when we want to be, fully aware.
