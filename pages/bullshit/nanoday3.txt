I made my wordcount quota for the 3rd day of NaNo!
Just barely!
And I cheated!

In three separate texts, or two-plus-one cause only two were actually fiction in the conventional sense and the third was a message to a writing buddy about my story--But I think it at least deserves an honorable mention, because it was still very good prose! And it got to take a look into my characters a little differently, as well as the possible directions I could go with this year's NaNoNovember.
